## 💬 A quote for thought
##### Ellen Ullman, Close to the Machine: Technophilia and its Discontents

🔭 “We think we are creating the system for our own purposes. We
believe we are making it in our own image... But the computer is
not really like us. It is a projection of a very slim part of ourselves:
that portion devoted to logic, order, rule, and clarity.” 🔭
