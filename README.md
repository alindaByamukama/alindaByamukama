## 👋 Hello there!
My name is Alinda Byamukama, I am a Junior developer based in Kampala - Uganda, with a keen interest in the intersection of web deelopment and social transformation. 
My current focus is on sharpening my web development skills and continuosly learning about how tech can be best used to create a positive impact on society.

 🌱 I’m currently learning AngularJS, ReactJS, NodeJS, Vanilla JavaScript and a little bit of TypeScript where needed 🌱

 🔭 I am working towards being a ✨FullStack Developer✨ with the Google Africa Developer Scholarship 2021 and Pluralsight. I also leverage Free Courses on Scrimba and Wes Bos from time to time. In future I hope to qualify for the AltSchool Africa program in 2022 and the Udacity Bertelsman Technology Scholarship in December 2021 ... I will update on progress as time goes on 🔭

## 💬 A quote for thought

🔭 “Everything I’ve achieved has come from perseverance.  I’ve never met another entrepreneur who had a painless path to success -- everyone who tries to bring new ideas to the world is tested. All aspiring entrepreneurs should remember that failure doesn't mean the end of the road. It can lay the groundwork for something even greater.” 🔭

Reshma Saujani is a lawyer and politician who was the first Indian-American woman to run for Congress. She founded Girls Who Code, an organization which supports and aims to increase the number of women in tech.
